				<div>
					<p>The rocky ledge runs far into the sea,</p>
					<p>And on its outer point, some miles away,</p>
					<p>The Lighthouse lifts its massive masonry,</p>
					<p>A pillar of fire by night, of cloud by day.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>Even at this distance I can see the tides,</p>
					<p>Upheaving, break unheard along its base,</p>
					<p>A speechless wrath, that rises and subsides</p>
					<p>In the white lip and tremor of the face.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>And as the evening darkens, lo! how bright,</p>
					<p>Through the deep purple of the twilight air,</p>
					<p>Beams forth the sudden radiance of its light</p>
					<p>With strange, unearthly splendor in the glare!</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>Not one alone; from each projecting cape</p>
					<p>And perilous reef along the ocean's verge,</p>
					<p>Starts into life a dim, gigantic shape,</p>
					<p>Holding its lantern o'er the restless surge.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>Like the great giant Christopher it stands</p>
					<p>Upon the brink of the tempestuous wave,</p>
					<p>Wading far out among the rocks and sands,</p>
					<p>The night-o'ertaken mariner to save.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>And the great ships sail outward and return,</p>
					<p>Bending and bowing o'er the billowy swells,</p>
					<p>And ever joyful, as they see it burn,</p>
					<p>They wave their silent welcomes and farewells.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>They come forth from the darkness, and their sails</p>
					<p>Gleam for a moment only in the blaze,</p>
					<p>And eager faces, as the light unveils,</p>
					<p>Gaze at the tower, and vanish while they gaze.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>The mariner remembers when a child,</p>
					<p>On his first voyage, he saw it fade and sink;</p>
					<p>And when, returning from adventures wild,</p>
					<p>He saw it rise again o'er ocean's brink.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>Steadfast, serene, immovable, the same</p>
					<p>Year after year, through all the silent night</p>
					<p>Burns on forevermore that quenchless flame,</p>
					<p>Shines on that inextinguishable light!</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>It sees the ocean to its bosom clasp</p>
					<p>The rocks and sea-sand with the kiss of peace;</p>
					<p>It sees the wild winds lift it in their grasp,</p>
					<p>And hold it up, and shake it like a fleece.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>The startled waves leap over it; the storm</p>
					<p>Smites it with all the scourges of the rain,</p>
					<p>And steadily against its solid form</p>
					<p>Press the great shoulders of the hurricane.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>The sea-bird wheeling round it, with the din</p>
					<p>Of wings and winds and solitary cries,</p>
					<p>Blinded and maddened by the light within,</p>
					<p>Dashes himself against the glare, and dies.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>A new Prometheus, chained upon the rock,</p>
					<p>Still grasping in his hand the fire of Jove,</p>
					<p>It does not hear the cry, nor heed the shock,</p>
					<p>But hails the mariner with words of love.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>"Sail on!" it says, "sail on, ye stately ships!</p>
					<p>And with your floating bridge the ocean span;</p>
					<p>Be mine to guard this light from all eclipse,</p>
					<p>Be yours to bring man nearer unto man!"</p>
